                <p class="text__paragraph first-paragraph">A large number of students visited the Dawn Education Expo on its opening day at the Karachi Expo Centre on Sunday. The event will continue till Monday evening.</p> 
                <p class="text__paragraph">Students from all across Pakistan started to pour into the venue since early morning to witness a variety of stalls set up by reputed international and Pakistani colleges and universities that could help them carve a better future for themselves. It's the eight edition of the education expo, the largest education exhibition of the country, and the students were eager to come to it,finding it the most reliable source of information on how to set their educational priorities, what procedures to follow and which educational institutions to apply to further their education.The exhibition is organised at a time when universities and colleges are open to take students in, and the right time for students to opt for a programme as per their requirement. The three halls of the Expo Centre were packed with students as they went from stall to stall, seeking relevant information. This time round even the number of courses offered by institutions (including the Ivy League ones) are of a wide variety, ranging from the usual science, arts and commerce subjects to disciplines such as fashion design and media sciences.</p>
                <p class="text__paragraph">Talking to Dawn on the occasion, Brian Sanders, New Zealand's ambassador to Pakistan, said: “It's a really good show as students get to learn how to study in a particular country. We have our stalls where students are informed about the things they want to know about New Zealand and its educational institutions. The quality of Pakistani students is very high, especially of those who come under the umbrella of the Higher Education Commission. A good student is a good student no matter where he comes from.”</p>
                <p class="text__paragraph">The head of the information and marketing office of the Preparation for Life (PFL) International, which has its stalls in one of the three halls, Chris Price, said: “Education is very important and all parents deem it paramount that their children improve their education. The urge to learn more is there. International students are always welcome because they bring in diversity, trade links and a lot of money. The issuance of visa for students is simple and the PFL has 95 per cent success rate in visa issuance. Pakistani students are bright and motivated and they know what they want, unlike their British counterparts who are mollycoddled into studying.”</p>
                <p class="text__paragraph">Apart from local educational institutions, participation of countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, New Zealand, Australia and Canada has made the exhibition a worthy place for young knowledge-seekers to visit. According to Azhar H. Shah of the Australian Trade Commission, every year 3,000 students get visas for Australia.</p>
